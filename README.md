# Data_Course_MILLERBERG

Hi all,
My name is Mitchell. I am from Salt Lake City born and raised.I love the outdoors and being physically active. In my free time you can find me snowboarding, disc golfing ,or backpacking. I am dual enrolled at Utah Valley University (UVU) and SLCC studying applied technology focused  in molecular and organic chemistry. Last semester, I completed my AS degree in Biotechnology at SLCC. I am currently working to graduate from UVU with a bachelor's degree in Bioinformatics and a minor in Chemistry. Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary field of biology that applies computer science to all parts of the scientific process to interpret the results obtained from experiments.
