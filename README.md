Introduction

Hi all,
My name is Mitchell. I am from Salt Lake City born and raised.I love the outdoors and being physically active. In my free time you can find me snowboarding, golfing ,or backpacking. I am dual enrolled at Utah Valley University (UVU) and SLCC studying applied technology focused  in molecular and organic chemistry. Last semester, I completed my AS degree in Biotechnology here at SLCC. I am currently working to graduate from UVU with a bachelor's degree in Bioinformatics and a minor in Chemistry. Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary field of biology that applies computer science to all parts of the scientific process to interpret the results obtained from experiments. I am generally new to programming and hope that I can keep up with you all. I am okay at VBA and excel in general. I am also familiar with R and SQL coding languages. I am excited to learn more about object oriented coding this semester and review the basics of computer systems. I have a lot to learn and am ready for the challenge
